Installation:
    - https://nodejs.org/en/
    - Install
    - Open cmd and type: node -v to get version of installed node

What is node.js:
    - JS can be used on server side
    - can create backend apps
    - Node.js is JS runtime
    - Integration with file systems so that you can read and write from disk
    - chrome sends JS code to V8 engine and V8 sends results to the chrome same with node 
        node.js send JS to V8 engine and V8 sends results to node
    - Node.js does not have window instead it has global (open cmd=> type node=> type global)
    - Node.js does not have document instead it has process (open cmd=> type node=> type process)

Why node.js:
    - non-blocking I/O : reading data from file, communication with servers
    - as node.js is non blocking IO it will continue to execute other process until it get response from servers etc.
    - Lightweight 

File system module: https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html

One file cannot access the variables from other files though we load files
To share we need to export the module and then files can share the variables
Whatever we add in module.exports other will get access to that after importing
